# DSPy Course Notes: Build and Optimize Agentic Apps with DSPy ðŸ“š

This repository contains the notebooks & code written while taking the [DeepLearning.AI short course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/dspy-build-optimize-agentic-apps/) on **DSPy**, created in partnership with **Databricks**.

## ðŸŒŸ Why DSPy?

**DSPy** is a flexible open-source framework that simplifies your applicationâ€™s interaction with LLMs. It streamlines your workflow by utilizing modular blocks in which you can provide a dataset of inputs and desired output, and systematically build, trace, and optimize your application. It provides a structured way to build, debug, and optimize complex agentic applications.

## Course Outline

The course is structured into several lessons, with corresponding notebooks in this repository.

- **Lesson 1: Introduction** (`01_introduction.md`)
- **Lesson 2: DSPy Programming - Signatures and Modules** (`02_signature_and_modules.ipynb`)
- **Lesson 3: Debug Your DSPy Agent with MLflow Tracing** (`03_mlflow_tracing.ipynb`)
- **Lesson 4: Optimizing Agents with DSPy Optimizer** (`04_optimizing_agents.ipynb`)
- **Lesson 5: Conclusion**
